Feedback:
-------------

What went well:
Intro was good
Covered so much in few months and still able to recollect most of it
You are able to come up with examples whenever asked
Use of pen-paper during problem solving

What to improve:
Always discuss the problem and the approach upfront
You are using way to much words while explaning
Always approach in a calm manner so that interviewer can catch up with your answer/approach
Need a little bit more practice on at least basic level of DSA/logical problem

let num = 2;
function double(num) {
  return num * num;
}
let res = double(10);
console.log(res);

var num = 2;
function addTen(n) {
  return n + 10;
}
var x = addTen(0);
var y = addTen(5);
console.log(x, y);
