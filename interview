Feedback:
-------------

What went well:
Intro was good
Covered so much in few months and still able to recollect most of it
You are able to come up with examples whenever asked
Use of pen-paper during problem solving

What to improve:
Always discuss the problem and the approach upfront
You are using way to much words while explaning
Always approach in a calm manner so that interviewer can catch up with your answer/approach
Need a little bit more practice on at least basic level of DSA/logical problem
